Prototype development for an eggs collection autonomous machine

# introduction
In the modern egg industry, the chicken eggs come from the cells with a conveyor belt to the tables.
The eggs collection machines that are available in the market designed for farms with chicken coops of over 10,000 chickens. 
The machines are big and covers area of 10 square meters and require a structural change that most farms cannot afford.
My family farm has a coop of 2,000 chickens.
The required time for picking the eggs is about an hour per person every day. There are bigger coops in the Moshav, of 10,000 chickens.
The required time for a worker to pick the eggs in these coops is about five hours every day. Even in the newest coops, picking method is the same.
The automatic eggs picking machine is designed to replace the operation of the worker.
it's small, adapted to each coop and does not require a structural change of the existing coop.
The aim of the project is to develop a prototype for a Pick&Place machine, with full automation.

**The project is divided into 3 main levels:**


  - Mechanical design- 
  Production, design and assembly of the Pick&Place prototype machine which allows movement in 5 degrees of freedom, collecting an egg with a vacuum without damaging the egg.  
  
 - Electronics-
Create the electrical circuit and building a program that controls the operation of electrical components that include servo motors, and vacuum taps with Arduino microcontroller. 
  
  - Image processing-
    Code written in Python language. Includes decoding the location and orientation of the egg and transferring the data to the microcontroller in order to collect the egg anywhere in the workspace, without any human intervention and in full autonomy.
